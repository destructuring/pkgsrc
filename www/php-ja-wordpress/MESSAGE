To use Japanese localized WordPress with Apache httpd 2.4, you will need
to perform the following steps.

1. Install databases/mysql55-server, and enable it, and set root password.

2. Create the database for WordPress.

	$ mysql -u root -p
	Enter password:
	mysql> create database wordpressdb;

3. Create MySQL user account for WordPress, and grant permission for them.

	$ mysql -u root -p
	Enter password:
	mysql> grant all on wordpressdb.* to 'wpadmin'@'localhost' \
	identified by 'wppassword';

4. Edit ${PREFIX}/share/ja-wordpress/wp-config.php, and it should have
   the following lines.

	define('DB_NAME', 'wordpressdb');
	define('DB_USER', 'wpadmin');
	define('DB_PASSWORD', 'wppassword');
	define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');

5. Edit ${PREFIX}/etc/httpd/httpd.conf, and Add the following line at
   the its bottom.

	Include etc/ja-wordpress.conf

6. Add the following line to ${PREFIX}/etc/php.ini.

	extension=mysql.so

7. Adjust ${PREFIX}/etc/ja-wordpress.conf for your environment.

8. Start Apache httpd 2.4, and access http://localhost/wordpress/ ,
   and enter website name etc.

For further post-installation customisation you may need to make
changes to file permissions etc. based on the functionality that
you require.  A good starting place for these issues can be found
in this article:
