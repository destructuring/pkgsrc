As we don't have a separate directory for builddir, AM_CPPFLAGS gets
resolved to "-I. -Ilib -I. -I./lib". This causes a trouble with some C
preprocessors because headers like lib/unistd.in.h use "#include_next"
directive and they all result in an infinite recursion. I think the
semantics of the combination of duplicate -I and "#include_next" is
not defined but I'm not sure.
